Chunking Strategies
Every strategy takes a docuent and returns a list of chunks.

A chunk is a dict:
    - id        "<doc id>#<two-digit-number>, kept stable for the same input
    - doc_id    the parent document, used for citations
    - title     the parent documents title
    - text      The text within the chunk. Exactly what gets embedded and what the model will read.

    The office has underperformed against its original business case and is under review. It employs 38 lawyers, against the 60 forecast when it opened. Revenue per lawyer is the lowest in the firm. The board's assessment of the office is filed under matter reference LP-3307 and is not for external circulation. A decision is expected by the end of the first quarter.
